<p>Hi, my name is <u>Stephen</u>. I am from <b>Attleboro Massachusetts</b>
I graduated Highschool last year, and <i>NEIT</i> was my first choice of 
schools. I am here for cyber security and it is my second term here.
I live in the residence hall and I've really enjoyed the time I've spent 
here so far. I like the lab time and classes so far.<p>
